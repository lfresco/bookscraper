# Look4Book

The main idea behind this script is to save time to people like me who love to spend their time lloking for books on the internet. This simple scraper will look for a given title, book on all the main websites that sell books (preferably used ones) and returns the user a list of information regarding all the copies on sale online. 

Right now it returns only a set of interesting statistics about the price of the book (min, max, mean) and a link to the best offer. 

The website currently implemented are currently focused on the Italian market: libraccio, subito, IBS and eBay. But it can be easily expanded to be helpful for users coming from all over the world.
